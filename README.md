# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Requirement
Python 3 : "number of decimal format"

Spark is not used in this project. So, you do not have to care about the version of Python available for your Spark cluster.

## Instruction

Run `cdsw-build.sh` on terminal
```
$ chmod +x cdsw-build.sh
$ ./cdsw-build.sh
```
Run `json_get.py`.

RUn `train_model.py`. 
Note: This script is able to run on Experiments. But you need to run on Python session to use GPU.

Use `model_api.py` for Model.
